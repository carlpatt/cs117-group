Group project for CS 117

Write a program that analyzes the contents of a text file and produces the following results: 1) the number of words in the text file; 2) the number of unique words in the text file; 3) the number of characters in the text file; 4) the number of occurrences of each lower case letter in the alphabet; 5) the number of occurrences of each upper case letter in the alphabet; and 6) the frequency of each letter, both upper case and lower case, in the alphabet. Make sure you organize and display your results in an appropriate format that is easy to read. The program should prompt the user for the name of a text file and then analyze the text to generate the results described above. If the file does not exit, the program should report the error and give the user another try to enter another file name. If the number of tries exceeds 5, the program should display an appropriate error message and exits. Use functions to make the development process manageable and structure your code into multiple files. Make sure you document the functions you introduce by writing concise, precise and clear comments before you introduce the prototype of each function.
